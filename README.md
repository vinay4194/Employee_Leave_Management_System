# Employee_Leave_Management_System

Its a simple leave management system using PHP.
An employee can Login with the provided id and password. He can apply for a leave, mentioning the reason and duration.
An Admin can Login and see all the leaves applied by the employees and he can Approve and Reject those leaves, Same will be updated to the Employee's id.
An Admin can also manage the employees where he can add and delete employees. He can also see the leaves according to the departments and types of leaves.

This is mostly a backend Project.
I have mostly worked on the backend of this, The front-end is mostly a downloaded template.
